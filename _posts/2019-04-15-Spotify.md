After spending a few hours exploring Spotify on Apple Carplay inside a 2017
Volkswagen Polo we encountered limitations that were resulting in constant distraction for
the driver while driving that are multiplied when driving with friends when trying to change
songs.
We tackled this by providing a playlist that everyone likes inside a car we will allow
the driver to focus on the road and without having his phone privacy exposed.
We based our initial research around the topics:

Automotive digital product design

State of In-Car UX

Social concepts of Spotify

Apple CarPlay Guidelines

Spotify vs Distractions for drivers

Dangers of UI in cars

Quickly we faced a huge gap between product guidelines and what is designed and available in the market for car dashboards. Risk free behaviour is not enforced and apps in apple carplay are still dependent on the use of the phone.
