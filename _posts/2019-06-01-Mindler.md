After spending a few hours exploring Spotify on Apple Carplay inside a 2017
Volkswagen Polo we encountered limitations that were resulting in constant distraction for
the driver while driving that are multiplied when driving with friends when trying to change
songs.  

We tackled this by providing a playlist that everyone likes inside a car we will allow
the driver to focus on the road and without having his phone privacy exposed.
We based our initial research around the topics: 
Automotive digital product design / State of In-Car UX / Social concepts of Spotify / Apple CarPlay Guidelines / Spotify vs Distractions for drivers / Dangers of UI in cars.  

Quickly we faced a huge gap between product guidelines and what is designed and available in the market for car dashboards. Risk free behaviour is not enforced and apps in apple carplay are still dependent on the use of the phone.

We decided to map more in detail the experience flow to map distraction moments while using Spotify with friends in a car:

And idealize it should be a linear experience without interruptions or distractions:

### Solution Ideation

After exploring several approaches like “pairing bluetooth connection”, “hotspot” and “friends activity feed” to this problem we ended up by focusing on a feature that wouldn’t need any interaction from other devices and could work with minimal interaction to start playing music that everyone can enjoy.

We envisioned a new feature for apple carplay and mobile that generates a playlist based on a mix containing songs from the public libraries of friends that are physically close to you, that will listen to music in the same event. Example of event: driving with friends, party, dinner, study group. Promote safe driving on car dashboard whenever risky behaviour occurs. 
With the current high usage of facebook accounts linked to Spotify, we will use this to find friends nearby and retrieve their their accounts to spotify to get their public libraries. 
We presented this idea to 10 users of Spotify and 8 would use this feature.  


### Proposal Outcomes

Reduces interactions and distractions inside the car, avoiding accidents.
No risk of privacy breach to find music while driving.
Saved time deciding which music to hear.
A easy way to find music everyone will like.
Avoid use of phone at all, bring people closer. 
This feature can be used in multiple scenarios.
Places Spotify more compliant with Apple Carplay guidelines that would now respect the following: “Eliminate app interactions on iPhone when CarPlay is active. CarPlay is the best and safest way to interact with apps while driving, and interactions should occur using the car’s built-in controls and display. Any required setup on iPhone should occur before the vehicle is in motion.” https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/carplay/interaction/iphone/  


### Business Model 

We aim to promote this feature in Carplay for all users (Free subscription) being our focus group and minimized dependencies to quickly get metrics of success. 
	For the ones that have Premium subscription they’ll be able to save generated playlists and also generate nearby friends playlists on Mobile to use in other environments.
