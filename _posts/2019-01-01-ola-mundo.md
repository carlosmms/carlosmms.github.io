Hello World

It’s the most famous program. Known as the first example in nearly every programming language for every programmer, where did this message come from?
As a function, the computer program simply tells the computer to display the words “Hello, World!” Traditionally, it’s the first program developers use to test systems. For programmers, seeing the two words on the screen means their code can compile, load, run and they can see the output.
