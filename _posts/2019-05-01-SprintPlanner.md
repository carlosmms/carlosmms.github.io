SprintPlanner application offers a solution that accelerates and optimizes the process of calculating the effort of tasks for each Sprint. This process is directly connected with development teams productivity and accuracy.
Learn about my journey and design process of building a user interface for this mobile-app and more about task estimation.



### Problem

*“Scrum teams attend a lot of meetings: daily Scrums, sprint reviews, sprint retrospectives … the list goes on. Add to this ongoing training, workshops, one-on-one sessions, and the most time-consuming of all sprint planning meeting. This creates the perfect situation for overworked but underperforming teams.”* — Pritam Tamang

While participating in a few sprint planning meetings I started to find a few patterned problems of a broken experience and process for accurate and fast estimation I defined a plan to improve it:

**Vision and Goals:** Definition of what is going to be built, main objectives, target audience.  
**Competitive Analysis:** Search of other web-apps that offer similar services to know their pros and cons and see how to make this service better.  
**Look and Feel Research:** See what is trending and what will be the graphic references to create the style guides.  
**User Journeys:** Define user-flows of the users and objectives.  
**Wireframes:** Focusing on the functionality and layouts do the main screens.  
**Style Tile:** Define typography, colors, icons, buttons, and states.  
**Mockups:** Create all the screens of the web-app and apply the look and file of the style tiles.  
**Clickable Prototype:** Built with Invision to be able to showcase different user flows.  

### Vision and Goals

After a few interviews and doing user observations in teams doing sprint plannings I was able to get more context and conclude that the current setup for estimations in development companies lacks speed and accuracy due to dependency on several tools to be used for task effort estimations:  

Team Forecaster — team allocation.  
Excel Sheets — reference board of team effort per task.  
Jira — access current tasks on the backlog.  
Planning Poker — synchronized estimation of task effort with remote colleagues.  

The **vision** is to remove the need for accessing these tools and make teams more agile, Team Captains and Developers will become more productive.

Framed variables: team availability, previous estimation references vs current tasks, information is not centralised and the estimation biases of non-sync and remote.

### Competitive Analysis

After researching for several possible competitors that could address the same goal or vision I came across tools like [Scrum Poker](https://scrumpoker.online/), [Planning Poker](https://www.planningpoker.com/) and different approaches to plan sprints like [Magic Estimation](https://www.wibas.com/scrum/magic-estimation/en), but they keep failing to centralize information, optimize connectivity with Jira and easily work with remote teams.

There is no current full solution in this market to compete with SprintPlanner. The closest competitor, Poker Planning, with slower results, has a starting price of 15€ per month.

My business value approach to win space in the market will be to offer a service with 60 days free trial period, after that time ends, to continue using the app the Company will need to unlock each team for the amount of 5€ per month, there is no limit regarding the number of team members using the app.

### Look and Feel Research

![look](/assets/images/sprintplanner/look.png)

I focused my research on tasks and project management applications and end up following these references for a cleaner and lighter experience.

### User Journey's

I mapped the user flows and main objectives of both my users that will use the application: the developer and team captain.

This helped me to realize that there are different behaviors and expectations while using the app.

**Team Captain** objectives:  
Selects tasks from the backlog for the team to estimate  
Approves estimations  
Access to the Reference Board  
Defines tasks to be included in Sprint  
Overview of Sprint Effort and Team Capacity

**Developer objectives:**  
Defines own availability for Sprint  
Estimates Tasks  
Access to the Reference Board  
Overview of Sprint Effort and Team Capacity

### Wirefarmes

This phase helped me to quickly test functionality and layouts and be able to change it without wasting time with color, fonts or iconography.


### Style Guide

![guide](/assets/images/sprintplanner/guide.png)

Here I defined my initial color pallet, font, buttons, and their states, iconography, input labels and states. This is meant to be scalable, as you keep working you use it as a reference to keep your style consistent and you keep adding here your new elements. For complex projects, it is highly advisable to use a [Design System.](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nngroup.com%2Fcourses%2Fdesign-systems%2F)


### Mockups

![mockups](/assets/images/sprintplanner/mockups.png)

In this phase, I combined my main pages from the wireframes and style tile and created high fidelity interfaces of my product. After achieving a level of certainty in the main pages I move on to create additional screens that include different states of the buttons or specific user flows that I want to demonstrate.

The prototype built in Invision is helpful in many ways. It allows you to test the user flows defined with other people than the ones creating the product, that are often highly biased and quickly do iterations before the development phase. It’s a better way to share the design since it’s a preview of how it will work.   
I hope you’ve found this helpful, good luck with your projects!
