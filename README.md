# Linguagens e Tecnologias Digitais 2 - 2019 - DXD - FBAUL - Carlos Soares

**Technologies / Techniques Used**

Google Analytics - Since this website is being used for portfolio purposes I’ve added it to be able to keep track of who is accessing it and if anyone is spending time reading long posts. This way I will be able to make changes based on use behaviours.

HTML/Jekyll - I have used a structure created in class. Jekyll allowed me to save a lot of time of coding since it creates all the duplicated HTML common on every page. It was very useful to have it running in the terminal to keep track of bugs. 

Front Matter/Liquid - Allowed me to quickly add content and settings to each post/project like banner, title, author, video, prototype without needing to code a different layout for each project.

SCSS - Allowed me to define variables of sizes and colours so I can quickly change all my CSS without manually change every class.

Responsive web design/Media queries - Designing mobile first allowed to quickly be presented in all screen sizes with a good usability experience.

Github - Allowed me to have all my changes organised with description, to be able to quickly test in production in different devices and revert changes if needed.

Flexbox - I’ve used flex to organise my projects into a responsive grid, I’ve found flex to give more flexibility into future changes into my projects content, while Grid, which I chose not to use is more foccused on layout. 

Form/Formspree.io - I’ve chosen to use a form, since it’s very annoying to click on an email link on a website and open the default software that majority of users don’t have setup or don’t use. 

Animations & Transitions - I’ve used animation to start and stop a text effect whenever home banner is hovered. Transition is used to when hovering projects to smooth the state change.
